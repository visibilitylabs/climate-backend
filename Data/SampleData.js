Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating <i>Deepwater Horizon</i> blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.</p>\n<p><i>A Promised Land</i> is extraordinarily intimate and introspective-the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.</p>\n<p>This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama’s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.</p>\n<p><b>‘What is unexpected in <i>A Promised Land </i>is the former president’s candour’ David Olusoga, <i>Observer</i></b></p>\n</div>",

What he doesn’t realise is that included in the pastoral scene is a mutant sheep with a star on its back, and in using this photo he has unwittingly captured the attention of a man in black who offers a menacing ultimatum: find the sheep or face dire consequences. Thus begins a surreal and elaborate quest that takes our hero from the urban haunts of Tokyo to the remote and snowy mountains of northern Japan, where he confronts not only the mythological sheep, but the confines of tradition and the demons deep within himself. Quirky and utterly captivating, A Wild Sheep Chase is Murakami at his astounding best.</p>\n<p><b><i>‘A Wild Sheep Chase</i> has the conventional hull of a thriller – a quest, a mystery, an extraordinary woman, and plenty of elegant duress – but its fantastic superstructure transforms it into something quite different…a science fiction fantasy, a romance, a metaphysical tease, or a dramatisation of philosophical ideas’ <i>Independent</i></b></p>\n</div>",

The company’s $25 billion IPO in 2014 was the world’s largest, valuing the company more than Facebook or Coca Cola. Alibaba today runs the e-commerce services that hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers depend on every day, providing employment and income for tens of millions more. A Rockefeller of his age, Jack has become an icon for the country’s booming private sector and as the face of the new, consumerist China is courted by heads of state and CEOs from around the world.</p>\n<p>Granted unprecedented access to a wealth of new material including exclusive interviews, Clark draws on his own first-hand experience of key figures integral to Alibaba’s rise to create an authoritative, compelling narrative account of how Alibaba and its charismatic creator have transformed the way that Chinese exercise their new found economic freedom, inspiring entrepreneurs around the world and infuriating others, turning the tables on the Silicon Valley giants who have tried to stand in his way.</p>\n<p>Duncan explores vital questions about the company’s past, present and future: How, from such unremarkable origins, did Jack Ma build Alibaba? What explains his relentless drive and his ability to outsmart his competitors? With over 80% of China’s e-commerce market, how long can the company hope to maintain its dominance? As the company sets its sights on the country’s financial and media markets, are there limits to Alibaba’s ambitions, or will the Chinese government act to curtail them? And as it set up shop from LA and San Francisco to Seattle, how will Alibaba grow its presence and investments in the US and other international markets?</p>\n<p>Clark tells Alibaba’s tale within the wider story of China’s economic explosion—the rise of the private sector and the expansion of Internet usage—that haver powered the country’s rise to become the world’s second largest economy and largest Internet population, twice the size of the United States. He also explores the political and social context for these momentous changes. An expert insider with unrivalled connections, Clark has a deep understanding of Chinese business mind-set. He illuminates an unlikely corporate titan as never before and examines the key role his company has played in transforming China while increasing its power and presence worldwide.</p>\n</div>",

Ambedkar One of the most inflammatory writings of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar, ‘Annihilation of Caste’ remains a strident indictment of the Indian society and its social stratification where the lowest segment was treated as untouchable. A lecture that was never permitted to be given because of its incendiary nature, ‘Annihilation of Caste’ was self-published and immediately became the eye of a storm. Radically against the Brahmanical caste system and Hinduism, it argued for a society based on equal opportunities for all. This volume posits Ambedkar’s views on caste vis-à-vis Mahatma Gandhi’s ‘Harijans’ and presents the debate that the two luminaries engaged in. Read in this context, the book provides an overview of the problem of caste in India.</p>\n</div>",

Peter Lynch and John Rothchild are known to carry a vast experience in investment decisions and their book is ideal for those looking for acquiring big level of success in the stock markets. The book explains the concept of successful investing in a very simple manner. Practicing the advices of the authors would not only benefit the tenured investors but also the novices.</p>\n<p>As per this book, investing money in any company isn’t a matter of luck and should not be played as a lottery game. There is an in-depth thought process behind that and through this book the authors help the readers know about picking companies which would prove to be worthy investing their money in. The book mentions selecting a company for investment by starting to look at its merits, followed by the chain of logics that apply to every investment that brings profits successfully.</p>\n<p>Sectioned as ‘Peter’s Principles, this book includes a list of principles by Peter Lynch that are a rich compilation to help investors make the best out of their wealth. Building an investment portfolio in its most profitable shape doesn’t always need a hand-holding but once the skill of investing is learnt, the investors can research by themselves and acquire necessary knowledge to succeed. Beating The Street was published as revised edition by Simon and Schuster in 1994 and is available in paperback.</p>\n</div>",

But this coffee shop offers its customers a unique experience: the chance to travel back in time. In Before the Coffee Gets Cold, we meet four visitors, each of whom is hoping to make use of the café’s time-travelling offer, in order to: confront the man who left them, receive a letter from their husband whose memory has been taken by early onset Alzheimer’s, to see their sister one last time, and to meet the daughter they never got the chance to know. But the journey into the past does not come without risks: customers must sit in a particular seat, they cannot leave the café, and finally, they must return to the present before the coffee gets cold . . . Toshikazu Kawaguchi’s beautiful, moving story ? translated from Japanese by Geoffrey Trousselot? explores the age-old question: what would you change if you could travel back in time? More importantly, who would you want to meet, maybe for one last time?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

You were rocking back on your heels, balancing on that thick yellow line that runs along the subway platform, waiting for the F train.

I tried to will the train to stop, just so I could say hello.</p>\n<p>After seeing you, all of the youthful feelings and memories came flooding back to me, and now I’ve spent the better part of a month wondering what your life is like.

Peterson offered an antidote to the chaos in our lives: eternal truths applied to modern anxieties. His insights have helped millions of readers and resonated powerfully around the world.</p>\n<p>Now in this much-anticipated sequel, Peterson goes further, showing that part of life’s meaning comes from reaching out into the domain beyond what we know, and adapting to an ever-transforming world. While an excess of chaos threatens us with uncertainty, an excess of order leads to a lack of curiosity and creative vitality. <i>Beyond Order</i> therefore calls on us to balance the two fundamental principles of reality – order and chaos ­- and reveals the profound meaning that can be found on the path that divides them.</p>\n<p>In times of instability and suffering, Peterson reminds us that there are sources of strength on which we can all draw: insights borrowed from psychology, philosophy, and humanity’s greatest myths and stories. Drawing on the hard-won truths of ancient wisdom, as well as deeply personal lessons from his own life and clinical practice, Peterson offers twelve new principles to guide readers towards a more courageous, truthful and meaningful life.</p>\n</div>",

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison.

One hundred pages. Millions of possible combinations… but only one is correct. Can you solve Torquemada’s murder mystery? In 1934, the Observer’s cryptic crossword compiler, Edward Powys Mathers (aka Torquemada), released a novel that was simultaneously a murder mystery and the most fiendishly difficult literary puzzle ever written. The pages have been printed in an entirely haphazard order, but it is possible – through logic and intelligent reading – to sort the pages into the only correct order, revealing six murder victims and their respective murderers. Only three puzzlers have ever solved the mystery of Cain’s Jawbone: do you have what it takes to join their ranks?

When her gift threatens the gods, she is banished to the island of Aiaia where she hones her occult craft, casting spells, gathering strange herbs and taming wild beasts.

Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia–who is slowly regaining her powers–it’s Ichigo’s job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.</span></p>\n</div>",

It shouldn’t take a worldwide pandemic and nationwide protests to bring economic and racial inequality to the forefront of problems we desperately need to solve. But now that the opportunity is here, what should we do? How can we create more equality, opportunity, and growth for everyone? Not someday, but what can government and the private sector do right now to disrupt a status quo that almost everyone wants to change?\n<p>In <span class=\"a-text-italic\">Common Sense</span>, the <span class=\"a-text-italic\">New York Times</span> best-selling author Joel Greenblatt offers an investor’s perspective on building an economy that truly works for everyone. With dry wit and engaging storytelling, he makes a lively and provocative case for disruptive new approaches—some drawn from personal experience, some from the outside looking in. How can leading corporations immediately disrupt our education establishment while creating high-paying job opportunities for those currently left behind? If we want a living wage for everyone, how can we afford it while using an existing program to get it done now? If we subsidize banks, what simple changes can we make to the way we capitalize and regulate them to help grow the economy, increase access, and create more jobs (while keeping the risks and benefits where they belong)? Greenblatt also explains how dramatically increasing immigration would be like giving every American a giant bonus and the reason Australia might be the best place to learn about saving for retirement.</p>\n<p>Not everyone will agree with what Greenblatt has to say—but all of us can benefit from the conversations he aims to start.</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>",

But hidden beneath the straightened hair and expertly applied makeup is a secret that her friends would never understand: Sam has Purely-Obsessional OCD and is consumed by a stream of dark thoughts and worries that she can’t turn off.</p>\n<p>Second-guessing every move, thought, and word makes daily life a struggle, and it doesn’t help that her lifelong friends will turn toxic at the first sign of a wrong outfit, wrong lunch, or wrong crush. Yet Sam knows she’d be truly crazy to leave the protection of the most popular girls in school. So when Sam meets Caroline, she has to keep her new friend with a refreshing sense of humor and no style a secret, right up there with Sam’s weekly visits to her psychiatrist.</p>\n<p>Caroline introduces Sam to Poet’s Corner, a hidden room and a tight-knit group of misfits who have been ignored by the school at large. Sam is drawn to them immediately, especially a guitar-playing guy with a talent for verse, and starts to discover a whole new side of herself. Slowly, she begins to feel more “normal” than she ever has as part of the popular crowd . . . until she finds a new reason to question her sanity and all she holds dear.</p>\n</div>",

Marc Brackett, author of </span><span class=\"a-text-bold a-text-italic\">Permission to Feel</span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">, knows why. And he knows what we can do.<br/>\n</span><br/>\n<span class=\"a-text-italic\">“We have a crisis on our hands, and its victims are our children.”</span></p>\n<p>Marc Brackett is a professor in Yale University’s Child Study Center and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. In his 25 years as an emotion scientist, he has developed a remarkably effective plan to improve the lives of children and adults – a blueprint for understanding our emotions and using them wisely so that they help, rather than hinder, our success and well-being. The core of his approach is a legacy from his childhood, from an astute uncle who gave him permission to feel. He was the first adult who managed to see Marc, listen to him, and recognize the suffering, bullying, and abuse he’d endured. And that was the beginning of Marc’s awareness that what he was going through was temporary. He wasn’t alone, he wasn’t stuck on a timeline, and he wasn’t “wrong” to feel scared, isolated, and angry. Now, best of all, he could do something about it.</p>\n<p>In the decades since, Marc has led large research teams and raised tens of millions of dollars to investigate the roots of emotional well-being. His prescription for healthy children (and their parents, teachers, and schools) is a system called RULER, a high-impact and fast-effect approach to understanding and mastering emotions that has already transformed the thousands of schools that have adopted it. RULER has been proven to reduce stress and burnout, improve school climate, and enhance academic achievement. This book is the culmination of Marc’s development of RULER and his way to share the strategies and skills with readers around the world. It is tested, and it works.</p>\n<p>This book combines rigor, science, passion and inspiration in equal parts. Too many children and adults are suffering; they are ashamed of their feelings and emotionally unskilled, but they don’t have to be. Marc Brackett’s life mission is to reverse this course, and this book can show you how.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

In <span class=\"a-text-italic\">The Little Book that Beats the Market—</span>a <span class=\"a-text-italic\">New York Times</span> bestseller with 300,000 copies in print<span class=\"a-text-italic\">—</span>Greenblatt explained how investors can outperform the popular market averages by simply and systematically applying a formula that seeks out good businesses when they are available at bargain prices. Now, with a new Introduction and Afterword for 2010, <span class=\"a-text-italic\">The Little Book that Still Beats the Market</span> updates and expands upon the research findings from the original book. Included are data and analysis covering the recent financial crisis and model performance through the end of 2009. In a straightforward and accessible style, the book explores the basic principles of successful stock market investing and then reveals the author’s time-tested formula that makes buying above average companies at below average prices automatic. Though the formula has been extensively tested and is a breakthrough in the academic and professional world, Greenblatt explains it using 6<sup>th</sup> grade math, plain language and humor. He shows how to use his method to beat both the market and professional managers by a wide margin. You’ll also learn why success eludes almost all individual and professional investors, and why the formula will continue to work even after everyone “knows” it.</p>\n<p>While the formula may be simple, understanding why the formula works is the true key to success for investors. The book will take readers on a step-by-step journey so that they can learn the principles of value investing in a way that will provide them with a long term strategy that they can understand and stick with through both good and bad periods for the stock market.</p>\n<p>As the <span class=\"a-text-italic\">Wall Street Journal</span> stated about the original edition, “Mr. Greenblatt…says his goal was to provide advice that, while sophisticated, could be understood and followed by his five children, ages 6 to 15. They are in luck. His ‘Little Book’ is one of the best, clearest guides to value investing out there.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

William James, once the leading psychologist in America, and one of the founders of the philosophical school of pragmatism, put it best:</p>\n<p><span class=\"a-text-italic\">“A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.”</span></p>\n<p>Pragmatism believes that the mind is a tool. Your mind should work for you, not against you. People who don’t master their mind, don’t believe it’s possible.</p>\n<p>They say: “I can’t help but thinking these things.”</p>\n<p>Well, you can TAKE CONTROL of your mind with enough practice. I’ve done it. And in THINK STRAIGHT, I share exactly how. It’s a quick read and you can use it to immediately to improve your thinking.</p>\n<p><span class=\"a-text-bold\">You have the ability to decide what you think. Or, you can choose NOT to think.</span></p>\n<p>And that is one of the most important and most practical things you can learn in life. Before I learned that skill, I would spend hours and hours inside my head. Just think about how much you think.</p>\n<ul class=\"a-unordered-list a-vertical\">\n<li><span class=\"a-list-item\">“I wonder what my boss thinks?”</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"a-list-item\">“What happens if I screw up and lose my job?”</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"a-list-item\">“What if my business never takes off?”</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"a-list-item\">“Does she love me?”</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"a-list-item\">“Why does my life suck?”</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"a-list-item\">“What if I get cancer?”</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"a-list-item\">“I can’t finish anything. What’s wrong with me?<br/>\n</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the list goes on.</p>\n<p><span class=\"a-text-bold\">THINK STRAIGHT reveals the recipe for taking control of your mind so you can improve your life, career, relationships, business.</span></p>\n<p>I wrote this little book in a way that you can read it more than once. And I hope that this book serves as an anchor to you–especially during trying times.</p>\n<p>The mind is the most powerful tool on earth. Change the way you think. And you’ll change your life.</p>\n</div>",

He was a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna. Influenced by Western esotericism, he was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian darsanas (teachings, practices) of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world, and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the contemporary Hindu reform movements in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. He is perhaps best known for his speech which began with the words “Sisters and brothers of America …,” in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World’s Religions in Chicago in 1893.</p>\n<p>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to humankind. After Ramakrishna’s death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World’s Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint, and his birthday is celebrated as National Youth Day.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"celwidget\"data-cel-widget=\"edpIngress_feature_div\"data-csa-c-id=\"5m9g8d-vkqls0-pxesnk-aiyuqc\"data-feature-name=\"edpIngress\"id=\"edpIngress_feature_div\"></div>\n<div class=\"celwidget\"data-cel-widget=\"richProductInformation_feature_div\"data-csa-c-id=\"f7ecny-sv8dtk-qt2u7y-jktk0t\"data-feature-name=\"richProductInformation\"id=\"richProductInformation_feature_div\">\n<div class=\"a-section a-spacing-none celwidget\"data-cel-widget=\"rich_product_information\"data-csa-c-id=\"cjryo-yj5jso-c1avfw-fulb1h\"id=\"rich_product_information\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Now, in the first book of an exciting new series on the cardinal virtues of ancient philosophy, Holiday explores the most foundational virtue of all: Courage.</p>\n<p>Almost every religion, spiritual practice, philosophy and person grapples with fear. The most repeated phrase in the Bible is “Be not afraid.” The ancient Greeks spoke of <i>phobos,</i> panic and terror. It is natural to feel fear, the Stoics believed, but it cannot rule you. Courage, then, is the ability to rise above fear, to do what’s right, to do what’s needed, to do what is true. And so it rests at the heart of the works of Marcus Aurelius, Aristotle, and CS Lewis, alongside temperance, justice, and wisdom.</p>\n<p>In <i>Courage Is Calling</i>, Ryan Holiday breaks down the elements of fear, an expression of cowardice, the elements of courage, an expression of bravery, and lastly, the elements of heroism, an expression of valor. Through engaging stories about historic and contemporary leaders, including Charles De Gaulle, Florence Nightingale, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Holiday shows you how to conquer fear and practice courage in your daily life.</p>\n<p>You’ll also delve deep into the moral dilemmas and courageous acts of lesser-known, but equally as important, figures from ancient and modern history, such as Helvidius Priscus, a Roman Senator who stood his ground against emperor Vespasian, even in the face of death; Frank Serpico, a former New York City Police Department Detective who exposed police corruption; and Frederick Douglass and a slave named Nelly, whose fierce resistance against her captors inspired his own crusade to end slavery.</p>\n<p>In a world in which fear runs rampant—when people would rather stand on the sidelines than speak out against injustice, go along with convention than bet on themselves, and turn a blind eye to the ugly realities of modern life—we need courage more than ever. We need the courage of whistleblowers and risk takers. We need the courage of activists and adventurers. We need the courage of writers who speak the truth—and the courage of leaders to listen.</p>\n<p>We need you to step into the arena and fight.</p>\n</div>",

His wife and brother had died; the magazine he and his brother had started, <i>Epoch</i>, collapsed under its load of debt; and he was threatened with debtor’s prison. With an advance that he managed to wangle for an unwritten novel, he fled to Wiesbaden, hoping to win enough at the roulette table to get himself out of debt. Instead, he lost all his money; he had to pawn his clothes and beg friends for loans to pay his hotel bill and get back to Russia. One of his begging letters went to a magazine editor, asking for an advance on yet another unwritten novel — which he described as <i>Crime and Punishment</i>.<br/>\nOne of the supreme masterpieces of world literature, <i>Crime and Punishment </i>catapulted Dostoyevsky to the forefront of Russian writers and into the ranks of the world’s greatest novelists. Drawing upon experiences from his own prison days, the author recounts in feverish, compelling tones the story of Raskolnikov, an impoverished student tormented by his own nihilism, and the struggle between good and evil. Believing that he is above the law, and convinced that humanitarian ends justify vile means, he brutally murders an old woman — a pawnbroker whom he regards as “stupid, ailing, greedy…good for nothing.” Overwhelmed afterwards by feelings of guilt and terror, Raskolnikov confesses to the crime and goes to prison. There he realizes that happiness and redemption can only be achieved through suffering. Infused with forceful religious, social, and philosophical elements, the novel was an immediate success. This extraordinary, unforgettable work is reprinted here in the authoritative Constance Garnett translation.</p>\n</div>",

Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers and culture shifters, she’s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead.</b></p>\n<p>Leadership is not about titles, status and power over people. Leaders are people who hold themselves accountable for recognising the potential in people and ideas, and developing that potential. This is a book for everyone who is ready to choose courage over comfort, make a difference and lead.</p>\n<p>When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don’t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it and work to align authority and accountability. We don’t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into the vulnerability that’s necessary to do good work.</p>\n<p>But daring leadership in a culture that’s defined by scarcity, fear and uncertainty requires building courage skills, which are uniquely human. The irony is that we’re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the same time we’re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines can’t do better and faster. <i>What can we do better? </i>Empathy, connection and courage to start.</p>\n<p>Brené Brown spent the past two decades researching the emotions that give meaning to our lives. Over the past seven years, she found that leaders in organisations ranging from small entrepreneurial start-ups and family-owned businesses to non-profits, civic organisations and Fortune 50 companies, are asking the same questions:</p>\n<p><b>How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders? And, how do you embed the </b><b>value of courage in your culture?</b></p>\n<p><i>Dare to Lead</i> answers these questions and gives us actionable strategies and real examples from her new research-based, courage-building programme.</p>\n<p>Brené writes, ‘One of the most important findings of my career is that courage can be taught, developed and measured. Courage is a collection of four skill sets supported by twenty-eight behaviours. All it requires is a commitment to doing bold work, having tough conversations and showing up with our whole hearts. Easy? No. Choosing courage over comfort is not easy. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and work. It’s why we’re here.’</p>\n</div>",

What today we call the “Meditations” take the form of a personal notebook, which wasn’t intended for publication. Aurelius called them “<span class=\"a-text-italic\">Writings To Myself</span>.” They were written in Greek, although his native tongue was Latin, and were probably composed while he was on military campaigns in central Europe, c. AD 171-175. He died, most likely from the plague or cancer, on a military campaign in present-day Austria. The work is divided into 12 short books.</p>\n<p>“Meditations” is perhaps the only document of its kind ever made. It is the private thoughts of the world’s most powerful man giving advice to himself on how to make good on the responsibilities and obligations of his positions. Trained in Stoic philosophy, Marcus Aurelius stopped almost every night to practice a series of spiritual exercises—reminders designed to make him humble, patient, empathetic, generous, and strong in the face of whatever he was dealing with. It is imminently readable and perfectly accessible. You cannot read this book and not come away with a phrase or a line that will be helpful to you the next time you are in trouble.</p>\n</div>",

To her children she is both curse and blessing, as they cope with the inheritance of her passions – and demons.

But this is not so much ‘state of the nation’ as state of our souls, marriages, families, hopes and careers – a sharp and sexy portrait of a dysfunctional group of characters, all different yet connected. There’s Nat, failed dramatist and reluctant lecturer, falling for a younger woman; Anthea, an eco-friendly lost soul obesessed with foxes; Libby, hardworking mother and advertising executive, the family breadwinner; Harry, Nat’s friend and ex-pupil, a journalist on a local paper, with a guilty secret of his own; and Jack, Nat’s blimpish but unexpectedly poignant uncle, who lives for fox-hunting, and runs a failing engineering company in East Anglia.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Beneath the bright familiar world of Blair’s Britain, there’s a dark undertow of political and personal disillusion, of mythologies and urban myths that circle round our apparently comfortable lives. South of the River, a tale of five people, two rivers, and many Englands, metropolitan and rural, black and white, is gloriously readable and brimming with art and life.</p>\n</div>",

Even at her birth, the Night Women – a clandestine council of fierce slaves plotting an island-wide revolt – recognize a dark force in her that they treat with both reverence and fear. But as Lilith comes of age and begins to understand her own feelings and identity, she dares to push at the edges of what is imaginable for the life of a slave woman. And as rebellions simmer and unspoken jealousies intensify, Lilith’s powers and sense of purpose threaten not just her own destiny, but the destinies of all the slave women in Jamaica.</p>\n</div>",

Don’t you feel powerless every time that happens? You know that your product or service is really good for your customer. You’ve done everything to get the customer interested. They obviously like what you’re selling, but they shift, they fidget and then inexplicably walk away to the competition.</p>\n<p>Being pushy is unnecessary…</p>\n<p>That’s because pushiness creates an unnatural situation. The Brain Audit doesn’t teach you how to use mind tricks. It’s not a system of coercion. It doesn’t psyche the customer into buying against his or her will.</p>\n<p>Instead it shows you how to attract the attention of a customer.</p>\n<p>It shows you how to keep that attention. It shows you where the attention wavers. And it takes you through a series of steps that we all take on a day-to-day basis when buying products or services.</p>\n<p>And not only does it show you a step-by-step method, but it gives you a checklist that takes the ‘iffiness’ factor out of your own marketing and communication.</p>\n<p>So what’s the ‘iffiness’ factor?</p>\n<p>On any given day, if you were to ask someone to critique your website, your presentation or your business cards, they’ll simply give you an opinion. And the opinion will vary from person to person. This variation leaves you confused.</p>\n<p>You’re not really sure if your marketing message is working at 20%, 55% or not working at all. And you suspect that you could vastly improve your results, if you had a clear set of guidelines and benchmarks.</p>\n<p>With The Brain Audit, you’re going to have consistent results<br/>\nThe reason why you’ll get consistent results is because of three simple reasons:</p>\n<p>Reason 1: The Brain Audit is built on a system. It’s not random.<br/>\nReason 2: It isn’t some magic trick. It follows the decision-making pattern that we use everyday.<br/>\nReason 3: You can spot the mistakes and fix them thereby improving attraction and conversion.</p>\n<p>So what’s in The Brain Audit? And how can it help you?</p>\n<p>Here is just a tiny preview of what’s in The Brain Audit</p>\n<p>How the Brain Goes Through Decision-Making: Do you often wonder what your customer is thinking? Don’t leave the thought process to chance and let that customer walk away. Your customers don’t want to walk away. They want to buy from you. So how does the brain make decisions? And what causes it to get confused?</p>\n<p>Is the Brain a Conveyor Belt?: Does the brain actually process thoughts in a step-by-step manner? Would you believe it’s not random at all? The Brain Audit is a tool that allows you to understand the predictability of a buying sequence. The moment you understand how the ‘conveyor belt’ concept works, you’ll see that your brain follows this sequence no matter what product or service you’re buying.</p>\n<p>The Hidden Trigger: This one factor will turn everything you’ve learned on its head. Readers have changed their business cards, their websites and their whole way of thinking once they learned the extreme power of this simple trigger. When you use this trigger, you activate the curiosity of the brain and get customers engaged. Customers start asking questions, and instead of shooing you away, invite you to tell them more.</p>\n<p>The Futility of Solutions: Most of us believe that we should talk about benefits and solutions. And benefits and solutions work, but they fail miserably if they’re placed out of the sequence. So where do you place your benefits? And why?</p>\n<p>Getting the Customer’s Attention: The core of getting attention is to flag a customer down. But how are you going to do that if you don’t even know what gets their attention in the first place? The Brain Audit not only shows you how to get their attention, but actually get a response. This response helps you go ahead with the sale.</p>\n</div>",

He fought back, the baddest of the bad kids: stealing, drinking, robbing and cheating his way out of the Alaskan bush – where he honed his artistic talent, fell in love with a girl and got her pregnant. To become part of a family, he reinvented himself – jettisoning all that anger to become a docile, devoted husband and father. Fifteen years later, when we meet Daniel again, he is a comic book artist. His wife teaches Dante’s Inferno at a local college; his daughter, Trixie, is the light of his life – and a girl who only knows her father as the even-tempered, mild-mannered man he has been her whole life. Until, that is, she is date raped… and Daniel finds himself struggling, again, with a powerlessness and a rage that may not just swallow him whole, but destroy his family and his future.</p>\n</div>",

One day, comfortable in her home and her second marriage, she receives – entirely out of the blue – a parcel containing the manuscript of her ex-husband’s first novel. He writes asking her to read the book; she was always his best critic, he says. As Susan reads, she is drawn into the fictional life of Tony Hastings, a maths professor driving his family to their summer house in Maine. And as we read along with her, so are we. As the Hastings’ ordinary, civilized lives veer disastrously, violently off course, Susan is plunged back into the past, forced to confront the darkness that inhabits her, and driven to name the fear that gnaws at her future.</p>\n<p>Tony and Susan is a dazzling achievement: simultaneously a riveting portrayal of the experience of reading and an engrossing thriller, written in startlingly arresting prose. It is also a novel about fear and regret, revenge and aging, marriage and creativity. Absolutely not to be missed.</p>\n</div>",

While she is living a life of a prostitute, trying to understand herself sexually, she comes across a man. She crosses path with a young painter. She is instantly smitten by his charm and he is captivated by Maria too. There is a chance that she might fall in love. At this strange time, love has found her door, will she let it in? Or will it be another sexual adventure for her? This honest tale of a woman’s journey to understand her physically and emotionally is bound to keep you hooked till the last page.

He is the real-life inspiration for the Iron Man series of films starring Robert Downey Junior.</p>\n<p>The personal tale of Musk’s life comes with all the trappings one associates with a great, drama-filled story. He was a freakishly bright kid who was bullied brutally at school, and abused by his father. In the midst of these rough conditions, and the violence of apartheid South Africa, Musk still thrived academically and attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he paid his own way through school by turning his house into a club and throwing massive parties.</p>\n<p>He started a pair of huge dot-com successes, including PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002. Musk was forced out as CEO and so began his lost years in which he decided to go it alone and baffled friends by investing his fortune in rockets and electric cars. Meanwhile Musk’s marriage disintegrated as his technological obsessions took over his life …</p>\n<p>Elon Musk is the Steve Jobs of the present and the future, and for the past twelve months, he has been shadowed by tech reporter, Ashlee Vance.

Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are Freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and Communication our ancestors couldnt even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness. What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s mark manson. In 2016, manson published the subtle art of not giving a f*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries. Now, in everything is f*cked, manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the Internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom even of hope itself. With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>",

THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER The eight masterly stories in this new collection are all told in the first person by a classic Murakami narrator. From nostalgic memories of youth, meditations on music and an ardent love of baseball to dreamlike scenarios, an encounter with a talking monkey and invented jazz albums, together these stories challenge the boundaries between our minds and the exterior world. Occasionally, a narrator who may or may not be Murakami himself is present. Is it memoir or fiction? The reader decides. Philosophical and mysterious, the stories in First Person Singular all touch beautifully on love and solitude, childhood and memory. . . all with a signature Murakami twist.

One April day, the impulse to write a novel came to him suddenly while watching a baseball game. That first novel, <span class=\"a-text-italic\">Hear the Wind Sing</span>, won a new writers’ award and was published the following year. More followed, including <span class=\"a-text-italic\">A Wild Sheep Chase</span> and <span class=\"a-text-italic\">Hard-Boiled Wonderland</span> and the <span class=\"a-text-italic\">End of the World</span>, but it was <span class=\"a-text-italic\">Norwegian Wood</span>, published in 1987, that turned Murakami from a writer into a phenomenon.</p>\n<p>In works such as <span class=\"a-text-italic\">The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</span>, <span class=\"a-text-italic\">1Q84,</span> <span class=\"a-text-italic\">What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</span> and <span class=\"a-text-italic\">Men Without Women</span>, Murakami’s distinctive blend of the mysterious and the everyday, of melancholy and humour, continues to enchant readers, ensuring his place as one of the world’s most acclaimed and well-loved writers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

They are the thoughts of a seer; the perfect union of beauty and truth in poetry from the pen of the greatest poet of modern India. While introducing this small volume to the West, W. B. Yeats wrote: “Though the work of a supreme culture, they yet appear as much the growth of the common soil as the grass and the rushes. A tradition, where poetry and religion are the same thing, has passed through the centuries, gathering from learned and unlearned metaphor and emotion and carried back again to the multitude the thought of the scholar and of the noble. “</p>\n</div>",

Much greater than space travel or perhaps even the next revolutionary medical breakthrough, what is at stake is the whole idea of the good life as we have known it.</p>\n<p>Immigration and inequality, globalization and technological disruption, slowing growth and accelerating climate change–these are sources of great anxiety across the world, from New Delhi and Dakar to Paris and Washington, DC. The resources to address these challenges are there–what we lack are ideas that will help us jump the wall of disagreement and distrust that divides us. If we succeed, history will remember our era with gratitude; if we fail, the potential losses are incalculable.</p>\n<p>In this revolutionary book, renowned MIT economists Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo take on this challenge, building on cutting-edge research in economics explained with lucidity and grace. Original, provocative, and urgent, <i>Good Economics for Hard Times</i> makes a persuasive case for an intelligent interventionism and a society built on compassion and respect. It is an extraordinary achievement, one that shines a light to help us appreciate and understand our precariously balanced world.</p>\n<p>In this ambitious, provocative book Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo show how traditional western-centric thinking has failed to explain what is happening to people in a newly globalized world: in short Good Economics has been done badly. This precise but accessible book covers many of the most essential issues of our day–including migration, unemployment, growth, free trade, political polarization, and welfare. Banerjee and Duflo will confound and clarify the presumptions of our times, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why migration doesn’t follow the law of supply and demand</li>\n<li>Why trade liberalization can drive unemployment up and wages down</li>\n<li>Why macroeconomists like to bend the data to fit the model</li>\n<li>Why nobody can really explain why and when growth happens</li>\n<li>Why economists’ assumption that people don’t change their minds has made has made polarization worse</li>\n<li>Why quite often it doesn’t take a village, especially if the villagers aren’t that nice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In doing so, they seek to reclaim this essential terrain, and to offer readers an economist’s view of the great issues of the day–one that is candid about the complexities, the zones of ignorance, and the areas of genuine disagreement.</p>\n</div>",

It was his last great novel, and many critics believe it to be his finest. Readers and critics alike praised it for its masterful plot, which rises above the melodrama of some of his earlier works, and for its three-dimensional, psychologically realistic characters—characters much deeper and more interesting than the one-note caricatures of earlier novels.</p>\n<p>It depicts the growth and personal development of an orphan named Pip. The novel was first published in serial form in Dickens’s weekly periodical ‘All the Year Round’, from 1 December 1860 to August 1861. It is set among the marshes of Kent and in London in the early to mid-1800s. The Great Expectations contains some of Dickens most memorable scenes, including its opening, in a graveyard, when the young orphan Pip is accosted by the escaped convict, Abel Magwitch. It is full of extreme coverImagery, poverty, prison ships, barriers and chains, and fights to the death. Upon its release, Thomas Carlyle spoke of “All that Pip’s nonsense”. Later, George Bernard Shaw praised the novel as “All of one piece and consistently truthfull”. Dickens felt Great Expectations was his best work, calling it “a very fine idea”.</p>\n<p>Throughout the narrative, typical Dickensian themes emerge: wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil. This book has become very popular and is now taught as a classic in many English classes. It has been translated into many languages and adapted many times in film and other media.</p>\n<p><strong>Charles Dickens:</strong></p>\n<p>Charles Dickens (7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world’s best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.</p>\n<p>The second of eight children, he grew up in a family frequently beset by financial insecurity. At age eleven, Dickens was taken out of school and sent to work in London backing warehouse, where his job was to paste labels on bottles for six shillings a week. His father John Dickens, was a warmhearted but improvident man. When he was condemned the Marshela Prison for unpaid debts, he unwisely agreed that Charles should stay in lodgings and continue working while the rest of the family joined him in jail. This three-month separation caused Charles much pain; his experiences as a child alone in a huge city – cold, isolated with barely enough to eat – haunted him for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>When the family fortunes improved, Charles went back to school, after which he became an office boy, a freelance reporter and finally an author. With ‘Pickwick Papers’ (1836-7) he achieved immediate fame; in a few years he was easily the most popular and respected writer of his time. It has been estimated that one out of every ten persons in Victorian England was a Dickens reader. ‘Oliver Twist’ (1837), ‘Nicholas Nickleby’ (1838-9) and ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’ (1840-41) were huge successes. ‘Martin Chuzzlewit’ (1843-4) was less so, but Dickens followed it with his unforgettable, ‘A Christmas Carol’ (1843), ‘Bleak House’ (1852-3), ‘Hard Times’ (1854) and ‘Little Dorrit’ (1855-7) reveal his deepening concern for the injustices of British Society. ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ (1859), ‘Great Expectations’ (1860-1) and ‘Our Mutual Friend’ (1864-5) complete his major works.</p>\n</div>",

A British writer and a social critic, Charles Dickens was considered a literary genius who created some of the world’s best-known fictional characters.<br/>\nDickens had to take care of the family at a very early age, due to his father’s imprisonment. This led to him feeling abandoned and betrayed and his impoverished childhood later reflected through his first novel — Oliver Twist.<br/>\nAmongst the many novels that he authored, David Copperfield, was considered the first of its kind, as never before anybody had written a novel that followed a character through his daily life. Though it was not considered as his best work, it was his personal favourite. Many of his major works have been adapted for films, with some, like A Christmas Carol, repackaged in various forms over the years.<br/>\nThis collection includes some of his most memorable stories, including A Christmas Tree, The Trial for Murder, A Walk in a Workhouse and The Poor Traveler.

Be prepared for writing which can be very philosophical, heavily symbolic, and full of strange coverImages. In Franz Kafka’s greatest works there is often no plot or dramatic tension, but the prose style (even in translation) is truly original. Kafka’s work is also full of black humour; he often writes both about and from the point of view of animals; and some of his shorter pieces are in the form of parables, meditations, poetic fragments, and sketches. Keep in mind that Kafka was one of many great writers who did not win the Nobel Prize for literature – along with Tolstoy, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Hardy, Virginia Woolf, D.H.Lawrence, and James Joyce. His work was hardly known outside his native Chzeckoslovakia during his lifetime, and yet it had immediate and enormous impact once it was translated in the late 1920s. He is now regarded as one of the giants of twentieth-century literature.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

In Lilliput he discovers a world in miniature; towering over the people and their city, he is able to view their society from the viewpoint of a god. However, in Brobdingnag, a land of giants, tiny Gulliver himself comes under observation, exhibited as a curiosity at markets and fairs. In Laputa, a flying island, he encounters a society of speculators and projectors who have lost all grip on everyday reality; while they plan and calculate, their country lies in ruins. Gulliver’s final voyage takes him to the land of the Houyhnhnms, gentle horses whom he quickly comes to admire – in contrast to the Yahoos, filthy bestial creatures who bear a disturbing resemblance to humans.<br/>\nGulliver’s Travels is a wickedly clever satire that uses comic inversions to offer telling insights into the nature of man and society.</p>\n</div>",

What are the traits needed to be a successful investor? Can one master the stock market or is it a gift one is born with? How does one build a portfolio and protect it? Learn from the masters. The Indian stock market is many things to many people. Some are drawn to its thrill and promise but, more often than not, they fail to recognize the risk that accompanies the reward of a great ride. For many, the market and its workings defy logic and mastery. However, within the universe of market watchers in India, there is a small group that has managed to build a fine set of navigation tools and develop a unique perspective and approach towards the market. They have created and institutionalized investment strategies based on their experiences and philosophies. Saurabh Mukherjea delves into the minds of seven such individuals asking them to elaborate on the tools they use and how these work. He traces their journey from being novices to successful long-term investors. Using their insights and his own experience of working in the market for nearly a decade, Mukherjea provides an essential and indispensable framework for operating in the Indian stock market.</p>\n<p>The interviews with prominent fund managers in the book are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sanjoy Bhattacharya</li>\n<li>Alroy Lobo</li>\n<li>Akash Prakash</li>\n<li>Sankaran Naren</li>\n<li>Sashi Reddy</li>\n<li>B.N.

A rigid man of fact, rational self-interest and realities, he not only teaches his pupils according to the utilitarian principles, but also raises his children with the same philosophy.<br/>\nWhen they grow up, as their lives begin to turn chaotic, they reproach their father for their upbringing. Will Mr. Gradgrind realize his flaws and become a humble man?<br/>\nSatirizing the laissez-faire system, Dickens’ Hard Times lays bare the wide gap between the rich and the poor. Criticizing the materialistic world, this Victorian novel throws light on the value of emotions and the human heart.

After carving her path all on her own, Beyah is well on her way to bigger and better things, thanks to no one but herself. With only two short months separating her from the future she’s built and the past she desperately wants to leave behind, an unexpected death leaves Beyah with no place to go during the interim. Forced to reach out to her last resort, Beyah has to spend the remainder of her summer on a peninsula in Texas with a father she barely knows. Beyah’s plan is to keep her head down and let the summer slip by seamlessly, but her new neighbor Samson throws a wrench in that plan. Samson and Beyah have nothing in common on the surface. She comes from a life of poverty and neglect; he comes from a family of wealth and privilege. But one thing they do have in common is that they’re both drawn to sad things. Which means they’re drawn to each other. With an almost immediate connection too intense for them to continue denying, Beyah and Samson agree to stay in the shallow end of a summer fling. What Beyah doesn’t realize is that a rip current is coming, and it’s about to drag her heart out to sea. “This book deserves a whole galaxy of stars, but alas, five is all I can give.” -Shades of Rebecca</p>\n</div>",

What do exceptional traders think when they purchase a quality stock and the price immediately plummets? How do they keep one bad trade from destroying their confidence – and bankroll? What do they know that the rest of us don’t? “Some trades are not worth the risk and should never be done.”High Probability Trading” shows you how to trade only when the odds are in your favor. From descriptions of the software and equipment an exceptional trader needs high probability signals that either a top or bottom has been reached, it is today’s most complete guidebook to thinking like an exceptional trader – every day, on every trade. “It’s not how good you are at one individual thing, but it’s the culmination of every aspect of trading that makes one successful.”Before he became a successful trader, Marcel Link spent years wading from one system to the next, using trial and error to figure out what worked, what didn’t, and why. In “High Probability Trading”, Link reveals the steps he took to become a consistent, patient, and winning trader – by learning what to watch for, what to watch out for, and what to do to make each trade a high probability trade. “Why do a select few traders repeatedly make money while the masses lose? What do bad traders do that good traders avoid, and what do winning traders do that is different? Throughout this book I will detail how successful traders behave differently and consistently make money by making high probability trades and avoiding common pitfalls…” – From the preface.Within 6 months of beginning their careers full of promise and hope, most traders are literally out of money and out of trading. “High Probability Trading” reduces the likelihood that you will have to pay this “traders’ tuition,” by detailing a market-proven program for weathering those first few months and becoming a profitable trader from the beginning.Combining a uniquely blunt look at the realities of trading with examples, charts, and case studies detailing actual hits and misses of both short- and long-term traders, this straightforward guidebook discusses: the 10 consistent attributes of a successful trader, and how to make them work for you; strategies for controlling emotions in the heat of trading battle; technical analysis methods for identifying trends, breakouts, reversals, and more; market-tested signals for consistently improving the timing of entry and exit points; how to “trade the news” – and understand when the market has already discounted it; and learning how to get out of a bad trade before it can hurt you. The best traders enter the markets only when the odds are in their favor. “High Probability Trading” shows you how to know the difference between low and high probability situations, and only trade the latter. It goes far beyond simply pointing out the weaknesses and blind spots that hinder most traders to explaining how those defects can be understood, overcome, and turned to each trader’s advantage. While it is a cliche, it is also true that there are no bad traders, only bad trades. Let “High Probability Trading” show you how to weed the bad trades from your trading day by helping you see them before they occur.Packed with charts, trading tips, and questions traders should be asking themselves, plus real examples of traders in every market situation, this powerful book will first give you the knowledge and tools you need to tame the markets and then show you how to meld them seamlessly into a customized trading program – one that will help you join the ranks of elite traders and increase your probability of success on every trade.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\">\n<div class=\"a-section text-direction-override\"dir=\"auto\">\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Everyone knows he’s a guaranteed good time—in bed and out—and that’s exactly how he prefers it. Until he meets Hannah Bellinger. She’s immune to his charm and looks, but she seems to enjoy his… personality? And wants to be friends? Bizarre. But he likes her too much to risk a fling, so platonic pals it is. Now, Hannah’s in town for work, crashing in Fox’s spare bedroom. She knows he’s a notorious ladies’ man, but they’re definitely just friends. In fact, she’s nursing a hopeless crush on a colleague and Fox is just the person to help with her lackluster love life. Armed with a few tips from Westport’s resident Casanova, Hannah sets out to catch her coworker’s eye… yet the more time she spends with Fox, the more she wants him instead. As the line between friendship and flirtation begins to blur, Hannah can’t deny she loves everything about Fox, but she refuses to be another notch on his bedpost. Living with his best friend should have been easy. Except she’s walking around in a towel, sleeping right across the hall, and Fox is fantasizing about waking up next to her for the rest of his life and… and… man overboard! He’s fallen for her, hook, line, and sinker. Helping her flirt with another guy is pure torture, but maybe if Fox can tackle his inner demons and show Hannah he’s all in, she’ll choose him instead?</div>\n<div class=\"a-section a-spacing-none celwidget\"data-cel-widget=\"rich_product_information\"data-csa-c-id=\"kizbi0-dpajmo-ywiwp6-e20xdv\"id=\"rich_product_information\"></div>\n<div class=\"a-section a-spacing-none celwidget\"data-cel-widget=\"rich_product_information\"data-csa-c-id=\"kizbi0-dpajmo-ywiwp6-e20xdv\"id=\"rich_product_information\">About the Author</div>\n<div class=\"a-section a-spacing-none celwidget\"data-cel-widget=\"rich_product_information\"data-csa-c-id=\"kizbi0-dpajmo-ywiwp6-e20xdv\"id=\"rich_product_information\">New York Times bestselling author Tessa Bailey aspires to three things: writing hot and unforgettable, character-driven romance; being a good mother; and eventually sneaking onto the judging panel on a reality show baking competition.

With the help of experts in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, political science, and finance, he has focused on what must be done in order to stop the planet’s slide toward certain environmental disaster. In this book, he not only explains why we need to work toward net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, but also details what we need to do to achieve this profoundly important goal.</p>\n<p>He gives us a clear-eyed description of the challenges we face. Drawing on his understanding of innovation and what it takes to get new ideas into the market, he describes the areas in which technology is already helping to reduce emissions, where and how the current technology can be made to function more effectively, where breakthrough technologies are needed, and who is working on these essential innovations. Finally, he lays out a concrete, practical plan for achieving the goal of zero emissions-suggesting not only policies that governments should adopt, but what we as individuals can do to keep our government, our employers, and ourselves accountable in this crucial enterprise.</p>\n<p>As Bill Gates makes clear, achieving zero emissions will not be simple or easy to do, but if we follow the plan he sets out here, it is a goal firmly within our reach.</p>\n</div>",

So what if Piper can’t do math, and the idea of sleeping in a shabby apartment with bunk beds gives her hives. How bad could it really be? She’s determined to show her stepfather—and the hot, grumpy local—that she’s more than a pretty face.</p>\n<p>Except it’s a <span class=\"a-text-italic\">small</span> town and everywhere she turns, she bumps into Brendan.

Yet as she reconnects with her past and begins to feel at home in Westport, Piper starts to wonder if the cold, glamorous life she knew is what she truly wants. LA is calling her name, but Brendan—and this town full of memories—may have already caught her heart.</p>\n</div>",

Jane’s parents died when she was still too little to remember them, and it is her uncle (her mother’s brother) who takes her in. Jane’s uncle also dies not to long after this, and he makes hir wife, Mrs. Reed, promise him that she will take care of his niece as if she were her own. Unfortunately for Jane, her aunt does not fulfill that promise: She considers Jane a bourdain and dislikes her for being poor. Her children are no better. Under their mother’s indulgence, they mistreat their cousin constantly, always making it clear that she is inferior to them.</p>\n<p>It is only at age ten that Jane managed to get out of her aunt’s house, but her quality of life does not improve much. She is sent to Lowood, a charity school directed by the cruel Mr. Brocklehurst, who does not hesitate in making the pupils face hunger, cold and even physical punishments in what he considers a chance to ‘save their souls’.</p>\n<p>Our protagonist remains at Lowood for eight years, six as a pupil and two as a teacher. After that, she decides that it is time to find a new situation and advertises in a paper offering her services to educate children. The only answer she receives comes from a place called Thornfield, in Millcote, and is addressed by a Mrs. Fairfax, who hires her to be the governess of only one child.</p>\n<p>Jane’s life in Thornfield Hall is more satisfactory that she could have expected. She likes Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, and her little pupil Adele, who soon become very fond of her, too. Jane also gets to know Mr. Rochester, owner of Thornfield, with whom she develops a strange friendship that eventually turns into love. But it will be no long until she discovers that the unequal social positions and the difference of age are not the biggest obstacles that their relationship has to overcome. On the eve of their wedding a terrible secret comes out, tearing Jane away from everything she has ever known.</p>\n</div>",

It is the story of the avaricious rich merchant Dhona, the poor lad Dukhey, and his mother; it is also the story of Dokkhin Rai, a mighty spirit who appears to humans as a tiger, of Bon Bibi, the benign goddess of the forest, and her warrior brother Shah Jongoli. The original print version of this legend, dating back to the nineteenth century, is composed in a Bengali verse meter known as dwipodi poyar. Jungle Nama is a free adaptation of the legend, told entirely in a poyar-like meter of twenty-four syllable couplets that replicate the cadence of the original. The first-ever book in verse by Amitav Ghosh, Jungle Nama evokes the wonder of the Sundarban through its poetry, accompanied by stunning artwork by the renowned artist Salman Toor. This is an illuminated edition of a fabulous folk tale that every book lover will want to possess.</p>\n</div>",

A system which seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves. This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living.<br/>\nThrough this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to craft our destinies.</p>\n</div>",

The novel is notable for its detailed portrait of the people, culture, and varied religions of India. The book presents a vivid picture of India, its teeming populations, religions, and superstitions, and the life of the bazaars and the road.</p>\n<p>Two men – a boy who grows into early manhood and an old ascetic priest, the lama – are at the center of the novel. A quest faces them both. Born in India, Kim is nevertheless white, a sahib. While he wants to play the Great Game of Imperialism, he is also spiritually bound to the lama. His aim, as he moves chameleon-like through the two cultures, is to reconcile these opposing strands, while the lama searches for redemption from the Wheel of Life.</p>\n<p>A celebration of their friendship in a beautiful but often hostile environment, ‘Kim’ captures the opulence of India’s exotic landscape, overlaid by the uneasy presence of the British Raj.</p>\n</div>",

She became regent when her son Dalip, barely six years old, unexpectedly inherited the throne. Sharp-eyed, stubborn, passionate, and dedicated to protecting her son’s heritage, Jindan distrusted the British and fought hard to keep them from annexing Punjab. Defying tradition, she stepped out of the zenana, cast aside the veil and conducted state business in public. Addressing her Khalsa troops herself, she inspired her men in two wars against the ‘firangs’. Her power and influence were so formidable that the British, fearing an uprising, robbed the rebel queen of everything she had, including her son. She was imprisoned and exiled. But that did not crush her indomitable will.</p>\n<p>An exquisite love story of a king and a commoner, a cautionary tale about loyalty and betrayal, and a powerful parable of the indestructible bond between mother and child, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni’s unforgettable novel brings alive one of the most fearless women of the nineteenth century, an inspiration for our times.</p>\n</div>",

In many successful organisations, great leaders are creating environments in which teams trust each other so deeply that they would put their lives on the line for each other.</b></p>\n<p>Yet other teams, no matter what incentives were offered, are doomed to infighting, fragmentation and failure. Why?</p>\n<p>Today’s workplaces tend to be full of cynicism, paranoia and self-interest. But the best organisations foster trust and cooperation because their leaders build what Sinek calls a Circle of Safety. It separates the security inside the team from the challenges outside. Everyone feels they belong and all energies are devoted to facing the common enemy and seizing big opportunities.</p>\n<p>As in Start with Why, Sinek illustrates his ideas with fascinating true stories, from the military to manufacturing, from government to investment banking. He shows that leaders who are willing to eat last are rewarded with deeply loyal colleagues who will stop at nothing to advance their vision. It’s amazing how well it works.</p>\n</div>",

In his most powerful book yet, Seth Godin argues that it’s more essential than ever to become indispensable – to become a linchpin. Linchpins are the essential building blocks of great organizations: they invent, lead (regardless of title), connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos. They love their work and pour their best selves into it and turn each day into a kind of art – and, in today’s world, they get the best jobs and the most freedom.</p>\n<p>Godin shows that the key to being indispensable is overcoming the fears that hold most of us back.

Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that Alcott based <i>Little Women</i> on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with “woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. <i>Little Women</i> brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the “girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.</p>\n</div>",

Macy Sorensen is settling into an ambitious if emotionally tepid routine: work hard as a new pediatrics resident, plan her wedding to an older, financially secure man, keep her head down and heart tucked away. But when she runs into Elliot Petropoulos—the first and only love of her life—the careful bubble she’s constructed begins to dissolve. Once upon a time, Elliot was Macy’s entire world—growing from her gangly bookish friend into the man who coaxed her heart open again after the loss of her mother. . . only to break it on the very night he declared his love for her. Told in alternating timelines between Then and Now, teenage Elliot and Macy grow from friends to much more—spending weekends and lazy summers together in a house outside of San Francisco devouring books, sharing favorite words, and talking through their growing pains and triumphs. As adults, they have become strangers to one another until their chance reunion. Although their memories are obscured by the agony of what happened that night so many years ago, Elliot will come to understand the truth behind Macy’s decade-long silence, and will have to overcome the past and himself to revive her faith in the possibility of an all-consuming love.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The first type drains intelligence, energy and capability from the people around them and always needs to be the smartest person in the room. These are the idea killers, the energy sappers, the diminishers of talent and commitment. On the other side of the spectrum are leaders who use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people around them.</p>\n<p>When these leaders walk into a room, light bulbs go off over people’s heads; ideas flow and problems get solved. These are the leaders who inspire employees to stretch themselves to deliver results that surpass expectations. These are the Multipliers. and the world needs more of them, especially now when leaders are expected to do more with less.</p>\n<p>In this engaging and highly practical book, leadership expert Liz Wiseman explores these two leadership styles, persuasively showing how Multipliers can have a resoundingly positive and profitable effect on organizations—getting more done with fewer resources, developing and attracting talent and cultivating new ideas and energy to drive organizational change and innovation.</p>\n<p>In analyzing data from more than 150 leaders, Wiseman has identified five disciplines that distinguish Multipliers from Diminishers. These five disciplines are not based on innate talent; indeed, they are skills and practices that everyone can learn to use—even lifelong and recalcitrant Diminishers. Lively, real-world case studies and practical tips and techniques bring to life each of these principles, showing you how to become a Multiplier too, whether you are a new or an experienced manager. This revered classic has been updated with new examples of Multipliers, as well as two new chapters one on accidental<br/>\nDiminishers and one on how to deal with Diminishers.</p>\n<p>Just imagine what you could accomplish if you could harness all the energy and intelligence around you. Multipliers will show you how.</p>\n</div>",

Tagore’s idea of nationalism is deep-rooted in his belief that growth has to be all-inclusive – not just for a nation, but also for its people. This book is a collection of Tagore lectures on nationalism in the West, Japan and India. His mastery with expression is further highlighted as he recounts the need of the concept of nation to benefit its people, and not just exist as an idealistic theory that benefits a few. Nationalism brings to fore Tagore’s deep understanding of contemporary politics and paves a middle path between growth of the people and a nation, and aggressive ways towards modernity.</p>\n</div>",

When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius? his coverImage is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There’s only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse. Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through? Casey McQuiston’s Red, White &amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn’t always diplomatic.</p>\n<p>“I took this with me wherever I went and stole every second I had to read!

Today there is just one. Us. <i>Homo sapiens</i>. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come?</p>\n<p>In <i>Sapiens, </i>Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, palaeontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come?</p>\n<p>Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, <i>Sapiens </i>challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power … and our future.</p>\n<p><b>‘Here is a simple reason why <i>Sapiens</i> has risen explosively to the ranks of an international bestseller.</b> <b>It tackles the biggest questions of history and of the modern world, and it is written in unforgettably vivid language. You will love it!’ – Jared Diamond</b></p>\n</div>",

Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?</p>\n<p>The shocking answer is: None of the above!</p>\n<p>In his groundbreaking <i>Secrets of the Millionaire Mind</i> , T. Harv Eker states: “Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!” Eker does this by identifying your “money and success blueprint.” We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.</p>\n<p><i>Secrets of the Millionaire Mind</i> is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker’s rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and “revise” it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.</p>\n<p>In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen “Wealth Files,” which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.</p>\n<p>If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that’s exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it’s simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you’ll get rich too!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Shantaram is narrated by Lin, an escaped convict with a false passport who flees maximum security prison in Australia for the teeming streets of a city where he can disappear.</p>\n<p>Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, the two enter Bombay’s hidden society of beggars and gangsters, prostitutes and holy men, soldiers and actors, and Indians and exiles from other countries, who seek in this remarkable place what they cannot find elsewhere.</p>\n<p>As a hunted man without a home, family, or identity, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city’s poorest slums, and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people. The first is Khader Khan: mafia godfather, criminal-philosopher-saint, and mentor to Lin in the underworld of the Golden City. The second is Karla: elusive, dangerous, and beautiful, whose passions are driven by secrets that torment her and yet give her a terrible power.</p>\n<p>Burning slums and five-star hotels, romantic love and prison agonies, criminal wars and Bollywood films, spiritual gurus and mujaheddin guerrillas—this huge novel has the world of human experience in its reach, and a passionate love for India at its heart.

Selling the shoes from the boot of his Plymouth, knight grossed $8000 in his first year. Today, nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of start-ups, nike is the ne plus ultra of all start-ups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognisable symbols in the world today. But knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, he tells his story. Candid, humble, wry and gutsy, he begins with his crossroads moment when at 24 he decided to start his own business. He details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream – along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls how his first band of partners and employees soon became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything. A memoir rich with insight, humour and hard-won wisdom, this book is also studded with lessons – about building something from scratch, overcoming adversity, and ultimately leaving your mark on the world.</p>\n</div>",

Follow interests wherever they take you—what feels like a hobby may turn into you life’s work. Forget the old cliché about writing what you know: Instead, write the book you want to read, make the movie you want to watch<b>.</b></p>\n<p>And finally, stay Smart, stay out of debt, and risk being boring in the everyday world so that you have the space to be wild and daring in your imagination and your work<b>.</b></p>\n<p>When asked to talk to students at Broome Community College in upstate New York in the spring of 2011, Austin Kleon wrote a simple list often things he wished he’d heard when he was their age: ‘Steal like an artist; Don’t wait until you know who you are to start making things; Write the book you want to read; Use your hands; Side projects are important; Do good work and put it where people can see it; Geography is no longer our master; Be nice (the world is a small town.); Be boring (it’s the only way to get work done.); and, Creativity is subtraction.’ After giving the speech, he posted the text and slides to his popular blog, where it quickly went viral. Now Kleon has expanded his original manifesto into an illustrated guide to the creative life for writers, artists, entrepreneurs, designers, photographers, musicians, and anyone attempting to make things – art, a career, a life – in the digital age. Brief, direct, and visually interactive, the book includes illustrative anecdotes and mini-exercise sections calling out practical actions readers can take to unleash their own creative spirits.</p>\n<p>“Brilliant and real and true.”—Rosanne Cash</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>",

Behind such a transformative soul was a bereaved childhood and a hardworking youth who started colouring the world with his own shade at the age of twenty and almost touched every sphere of human comfort with his discovery of Apple in his foster parent’s garage with his friend Steve Wozniak. Steve did not stop there, as he also invented Pixar. This biography of Steve is unbiased as Blumenthal covers the dark as well as the brilliant aspects of this hardware-software guru of all the ages.</p>\n<p>Various facets of Steve Jobs can be known from the biography. Blumenthal’s untiring efforts and detailed research on Steve Jobs have revealed him a passionate father, a caring husband, and a devoted Buddhist. The biography also covers that dark phase of his life when he was bravely fighting against cancer for a decade. The book highlights those qualities of Steve Jobs which have made him a perfectionist and a great software and business figure of the century.</p>\n<p>Steve Jobs: The Man Who Thought Different was published by Bloomsbury India Private Limited in the year 2013. It is available in paperback.</p>\n<p>Key Features:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The book is written in a very different style. Blumenthal has provided certain details about Steve in illustrative boxes.</li>\n<li>The information provided is unbiased and authentic since she has used Steve’s own speech for Stanford in 2005 on himself as a resource.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

The Zen Buddhists described it as inner peace, the Stoics called it a&lt;i&gt;taraxia &lt;/i&gt;and Ryan Holiday calls it stillness: the ability to be steady, focused and calm in a constantly busy world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This quality, valued by every major school of thought from Buddha to Seneca, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, is urgently necessary today. And, Holiday shows, it is entirely attainable. Just as Winston Churchill used bricklaying as a time to recharge and reflect, or Oprah Winfrey learned deep empathy from her quiet childhood, we can all benefit from stillness to feed into our greater ambitions – whether winning a battle, building a business, or simply finding happiness, peace and self-direction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with wisdom and examples from historical and contemporary figures, this book shows how to cultivate this quality in your own life. Because stillness is not merely inactivity, but the doorway to the self-mastery, discipline and focus necessary to succeed in this competitive, noisy world.</p>\n</div>",

His vignettes of life in British India give vivid insights into Anglo-India at work and play and into the character of the Indians themselves. Witty, wry, sometimes cynical, these tales with their brevity and concentration of effect are landmarks in the history of the short story as an art-form. Politics, the Raj and the life of the common soldier are some of the familiar themes associated with Kipling but these stories also reflect the more unexpected aspects of Kipling’s character and the different influences of the contrasting countries India, America and England in which he lived. His progressive portrayal of women, his interest in supernatural and religious experiences, his understanding of the processes of mental and spiritual breakdown and the curative powers of art, are all revealed in this fascinating perspective of a great writer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>",

If you want to know why you are not doing something right, sometimes all you need is to perform an analysis of your habits and consider altering them. Because sometimes it’s not about what you do, but more about how you do it! And that’s where your habits play a very important role.</p>\n<p>‘The 7 habits of Highly Effective People’ is a book that aims at providing its readers with the importance of character ethics and personality ethics. The author talks about the values of integrity, courage, a sense of justice and most importantly, honesty. The book is a discussion about the seven most essential habits that every individual must adopt to in order to live a life which is more fulfilling.</p>\n<p><b>Content of the book:</b></p>\n<p>The author continues to take the readers through the journey of character development. He elaborates how the development of the character of a being ranges from the time of his birth to the years until he grows independent. The first three habits demark the development one goes from dependence to independence. The next three habits describe in detail about interdependence while the final seventh habit deals with the new self, that is renewal.</p>\n<p>The book is highly recommended for people of all ages. It also holds a record of having over 25 million copies sold in about as many as 40 languages all over the world.</p>\n<p><b>About the Author:</b></p>\n<p>Stephen R Covey, the author of the book, is known to hold an MBA from the Harvard University. In his previous years of schooling, Covey also has studied Religious Education and Business Administration. It was in his doctoral thesis that Covey came across a contrast in the literature regarding self-help. His observations marked that the books post 1920’s focused highly on personality traits while the ones before that focused on character development. That is when the author put forth his belief about how a balance between the two is more essential than the two in isolation.</p>\n<p>You can bag this book from Amazon.in today by following a few easy steps.</p>\n</div>",

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.</p>\n<p>Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives “lickings” from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn ­ the town’s social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a “tattle-tale.”</p>\n<p>As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get “engaged” by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been “engaged” previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.</p>\n</div>",

It contains Marx and Engels’ theories about the nature of society and politics, that in their own words, “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles”. It also briefly features their ideas for how the capitalist society of the time would eventually be replaced by socialism, and then finally Communism.</p>\n<p><strong>KARL MARX</strong> (1818-1883) was a philosopher, social scientist, historian and political revolutionary. He is indisputably the most influential socialist thinker to emerge in the 19th century. Although scholars largely ignored him in his own lifetime, his social, economic and political ideas gained rapid acceptance in the socialist movement only after his death.</p>\n<p>Born to a bourgeois family, <strong>FREDERICK ENGELS</strong> (1820-1895) devoted his life to struggling for the poor and oppressed. As a man of principle, he spent much of his time developing theoretical ideas and to his 50-year commitment to revolutionary socialism. Engels sustained an equally strong personal commitment to Karl Marx, who he supported politically, financially and with a deep friendship for 40 years, until the relationship was broken by Marx’s death in 1883.</p>\n</div>",

For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.</p>\n</div>",

But tonight…I resurrect the battle.</p>\n<p>Ryan Henderson is back in town for our best friends’ wedding, and I plan on showing him exactly how much I don’t care about him—or the almost kiss he ruthlessly dangled over me after graduation. A lot has changed since our feuding days. I’m a successful bakery owner now, and I plan to rub every delicious detail of my life in his ugly face. Just one problem: his face is gorgeous. He wasn’t supposed to look like this or pursue me like a sexy guided missile. I must stay strong until the wedding is over and Ryan scurries back into whatever alternate universe he escaped from. His interest in me is nothing but a continuation of the games we played in high school…right?</p>\n<p>But the longer he stays, the more I wonder if I’m wrong and his tender smile and heated attentions are genuine. Maybe it’s not a game. Ha! Who am I kidding? This is Ryan we’re talking about. Of course it’s a game. A game called war.

The purpose of all true creative art, he believed, is to teach. But the message in all his stories is presented with such humor that the reader hardly realizes that it is strongly didactic. The seven parts into which this book is divided include the best known Tolstoy stories. “God Sees the Truth, but Waits” and “A Prisoner in the Caucasus” which Tolstoy himself considered as his best, “How Much Land Does a Man Need?” depicting the greed of a peasant for land, the most brilliantly told parable, “Ivan the Fool” these are all contained in this volume.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"celwidget\"data-cel-widget=\"globalStoreInfoBullets_feature_div\"data-csa-c-id=\"9i8rnn-4xe822-cshs1p-3ma9b0\"data-feature-name=\"globalStoreInfoBullets\"id=\"globalStoreInfoBullets_feature_div\"></div>\n<div class=\"celwidget\"data-cel-widget=\"edpIngress_feature_div\"data-csa-c-id=\"xsbhdh-6gyj3s-fv088h-u4lenv\"data-feature-name=\"edpIngress\"id=\"edpIngress_feature_div\"></div>\n<div class=\"celwidget\"data-cel-widget=\"richProductInformation_feature_div\"data-csa-c-id=\"ksozls-9l6oej-90y6c1-mux1su\"data-feature-name=\"richProductInformation\"id=\"richProductInformation_feature_div\">\n<div class=\"a-section a-spacing-none celwidget\"data-cel-widget=\"rich_product_information\"data-csa-c-id=\"ccaldo-qcp5xf-s357f4-3nufma\"id=\"rich_product_information\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

For Arthur Dent, who has only just had his house demolished that morning, this seems already to be rather a lot to cope with. Sadly, however, the weekend has only just begun. The Galaxy may offer a mind-boggling variety of ways to be blown up and/or insulted, but it’s very hard to get a cup of tea.</p>\n<p>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</p>\n<p>When all questions of space, time, matter and the nature of being have been resolved, only one question remains – ‘Where shall we have dinner? The Restaurant at the End of the Universe provides the ultimate gastronomic experience, and for once there is no morning after to worry about.</p>\n<p>Life, the Universe and Everything</p>\n<p>Following a number of stunning catastrophes, Arthur Dent is surprised to find himself living in a hideously miserable cave on prehistoric Earth. However, just as he thinks that things cannot get possibly worse, they suddenly do. An eddy in the space-time continuum lands him, Ford Prefect, and their flying sofa in the middle of the cricket ground at Lord’s, just two days before the world is due to be destroyed by the Vogons. Escaping the end of the world for a second time, Arthur, Ford, and their old friend Slartibartfast embark (reluctantly) on a mission to save the whole galaxy from fanatical robots. Not bad for a man in his dressing gown.</p>\n<p>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</p>\n<p>There is a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. It’s not an easy thing to do, and Arthur Dent thinks he’s the only human who’s been able to master this nifty little trick ? until he meets Fenchurch, the woman of his dreams. Fenchurch once realised how the world could be made a good and happy place. Unfortunately, she’s forgotten. Convinced that the secret lies within God’s Final Message to His Creation, they go in search of it. And, in a dramatic break with tradition, actually find it . . .</p>\n<p>Mostly Harmless</p>\n<p>Arthur Dent has settled down on the small planet Lamuella and has embraced his role as a Sandwich Maker. However, his plans for a quiet life are thrown awry by the unexpected arrival of his daughter. There’s nothing worse than a frustrated teenager with a copy of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy in their hands. When she runs away, Arthur goes after her determined to save her from the horrors of the universe.

Now he turns to the most important subject of all – understanding people’s drives and motivations, even when they are unconscious of them themselves. We are social animals. Our very lives depend on our relationships with people. Knowing why people do what they do is the most important tool we can possess, without which our other talents can only take us so far. Drawing from the ideas and examples of Pericles, Queen Elizabeth I, Martin Luther King Jr, and many others, Greene teaches us how to detach ourselves from our own emotions and master self-control, how to develop the empathy that leads to insight, how to look behind people’s masks, and how to resist conformity to develop your singular sense of purpose. Whether at work, in relationships, or in shaping the world around you, The Laws of Human Nature offers brilliant tactics for success, self-improvement, and self-defence.</p>\n</div>",

Consisting of a series of episodes in the story of the English outlaw Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men, the novel compiles traditional material into a coherent narrative in a colorful, invented “old English” idiom that preserves some flavor of the ballads, and adapts it for children. The novel is notable for taking the subject of Robin Hood, which had been increasingly popular through the 19th century, in a new direction that influenced later writers, artists, and filmmakers through the next century.[1]Pyle had been submitting illustrated poems and fairy tales to New York publications since 1876, and had met with success. The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood was the first novel he attempted. He took his material from Middle Age ballads and wove them into a cohesive story, altering them for coherence and the tastes of his child audience. For example, he included “Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar” in the narrative order to reintroduce Friar Tuck. He needed a cooperative priest for the wedding of outlaw Allan a Dale (Pyle’s spelling of the original Alan-a-Dale) to his sweetheart Ellen. In the original “A Gest of Robyn Hode”, the life is saved of an anonymous wrestler who had won a bout but was likely to be murdered because he was a stranger. Pyle adapted it and gave the wrestler the identity of David of Doncaster, one of Robin’s band in the story “Robin Hood and the Golden Arrow.” In his novelistic treatment of the tales, Pyle thus developed several characters who had been mentioned in only one ballad, such as David of Doncaster or Arthur a Bland.</p>\n<p>Pyle’s book continued the 19th-century trend of portraying Robin Hood as a heroic outlaw who robs the rich to feed the poor; this portrayal contrasts with the Robin Hood of the ballads, where the protagonist is an out-and-out crook, whose crimes are motivated by personal gain rather than politics or a desire to help others.[1] For instance, he modified the ballad “Robin Hood’s Progress to Nottingham”, changing it from Robin killing fourteen foresters for not honoring a bet to Robin defending himself against a band of armed robbers. Pyle has Robin kill only one man, who shoots at him first. Tales are changed in which Robin steals all that an ambushed traveler carried, such as “Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford”, so that the victim keeps a third and another third is dedicated to the poor.</p>\n<p>Pyle did not have much concern for historical accuracy, but he renamed the queen-consort in the story “Robin Hood and Queen Katherine” as Eleanor (of Aquitaine). This made her compatible historically with King Richard the Lion-Hearted, with whom Robin eventually makes peace.</p>\n</div>",

Mainstream financial gurus hoodwink you into believing that wealth can be created by recklessly trusting in the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the stock market, The job market, and the housing market. They propagate a dream-stealing, soul-sucking dogma known as “get rich slow”, which dubiously promises “wealth-in-a-wheelchair”―leading you to sacrifice your youth for a financial plan that reaps dividends only in life’s Twilight. If you accept this “slowly” as your blueprint for wealth, your financial future will drift carelessly on a sailboat of “hope and pray”. for those who don’t want a lifetime subscription to mediocrity and a path to elderly riches, there is an alternative; an expressway to extraordinary wealth that can burn a trail to financial independence faster than any other roads out there. Switch lanes, go fastball, and win financial freedom young, not old. This powerful book will teach you: why “wealth-in-wheelchair”, 40 year jobs, retirement plans, indexed-funds, mindless frugality and other “financial guru-speak” strategies will never make you rich. Why most “get rich” books only make the authors rich―not you! How to truly feel wealthy now, even if you’re flat broke. The 5 wealth commandments―how to create a millionaire-making income! The #1 leading cause of poorness―start here and you can change everything! How you can make NET worth explosions of 400% or more; say goodbye to paltry 8% stock market returns! Why the Guru nonsense of “do what you love”, “follow your passion” and other feel-good platitudes are most likely only dead end roads to wealth.

With a simple change of attitude, what seem like insurmountable obstacles become once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Ryan Holiday, who dropped out of college at nineteen to serve as an apprentice to bestselling ‘modern Machiavelli’ Robert Greene and is now a media consultant for billion-dollar brands, draws on the philosophy of the Stoics to guide you in every situation, showing that what blocks our path actually opens one that is new and better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the competition threatens you, it’s time to be fearless, to display your courage. An impossible deadline becomes a chance to show how dedicated you are. And as Ryan discovered as Director of Marketing for American Apparel, if your brand is generating controversy – it’s also potentially generating publicity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Stoic philosophy – that what is &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; the way, &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the way – can be applied to any problem: it’s a formula invented more than 2,000 years ago, whose effectiveness has been proven in battles and board rooms ever since. From Barack Obama’s ability to overcome obstacles in his election races, to the design of the iPhone, the stoic philosophy has helped its users become world-beaters</p>\n</div>",

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg translates cutting-edge behavioural science into practical self-improvement action, distilling advanced neuroscience into fascinating narratives of transformation.</p>\n<p>Why can some people and companies change overnight, and some stay stuck in their old ruts? The answer lies deep in the human brain, and The Power of Habits reveals the secret pressure points that can change a life. From Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps to Martin Luther King Jr., from the CEO of Starbucks to the locker rooms of the NFL, Duhigg explores the incredible results of keystone habits, and how they can make all the difference between billions and millions, failure and success – or even life and death.</p>\n<p>The Power of Habit makes an exhilarating case: the key to almost any door in life is instilling the right habit. From exercise to weight loss, childrearing to productivity, market disruption to social revolution, and above all success, the right habits can change everything.</p>\n<p>Habits aren’t destiny. They’re science, one which can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.</p>\n<p>______________________________</p>\n<p>‘<i>Plenty of business books that try to tap into the scientific world manage to distil complicated research into readable prose.

How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.

Her family is happy to announce that she will bring her American boyfriend to her sister’s wedding. Everyone is invited to come and witness the most magical event of the year. That would certainly be tomorrow’s headline in the local newspaper of the small Spanish town I came from. Or the epitaph on my tombstone, seeing the turn my life had taken in the span of a phone call. Four weeks wasn’t a lot of time to find someone willing to cross the Atlantic–from NYC and all the way to Spain–for a wedding. Let alone, someone eager to play along my charade. But that didn’t mean I was desperate enough to bring the 6’4 blue eyed pain in my ass standing before me. Aaron Blackford. The man whose main occupation was making my blood boil had just offered himself to be my date. Right after inserting his nose in my business, calling me delusional, and calling himself my best option. See? Outrageous. Aggravating. Blood boiling. And much to my total despair, also right. Which left me with a surly and extra large dilemma in my hands. Was it worth the suffering to bring my colleague and bane of my existence as my fake boyfriend to my sister’s wedding? Or was I better off coming clean and facing the consequences of my panic induced lie? Like my abuela would say, que dios nos pille confesados.</p>\n</div>",

He says that he was after truth rooted in devotion to God and attributed the turning points, successes, and challenges in his life to the will of God. His attempts to get closer to this divine power led him to seek purity through simple living, dietary practices ( he called himself a fruitarian), celibacy, and ahimsa, a life without violence. It is in this sense that he calls his book The Story of My Experiments with Truth, offering it also as a reference for those who would follow in his footsteps.</p>\n</div>",

He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mind-set that has infected</p>\n<p>American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.</p>\n<p>Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—“not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society and some of it is not fair or your fault.” Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace<br/>\nour fears, faults and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity and forgiveness we seek.</p>\n<p>There are only so many things we can give a fuck about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience.</p>\n<p>A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in the-eye moment of real talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them truly lead contented, grounded lives.</p>\n</div>",

This is a book dedicated to understanding how some of the world′s top professionals approach the challenge of making money out of stocks, their methods and philosophies. “In Buddhism, sitting at the feet of the master is well understood as the most effective way to learn. Investment professionals have no such mantra and it is unusual for the “stars” to share their experiences and approaches. In this book, Andrew Leeming has interviewed the world′s leading investors and analysts to understand how they managed to achieve great success. With the spread of publicly available information–in particular via the Internet–adding value, interpreting and utilising this information is critical in the investment process. These interviews allow the reader to benefit from the experiences of experts and will act as a guide which is as effective as sitting at their feet. This book is insightful and an essential read for all interested in investing.” – David Robins Chairman &amp; CEO ING Barings “Andrew Leeming has put together a series of great in–depth interviews with a wide gamut of investors that pose intelligent questions and get intelligent answers. It′s a great and easy read for anyone seriously interested in how stock market professionals work day in and day out.” – Rob Ferguson Chairman BT Funds Management “In this day of all–star research teams, when short–term performance is sometimes carried to irrational extremes, it′s refreshing to hear that some of the best stock–pickers think success boils down to such fundamental issues as discipline, a healthy dose of skepticism.and humility! If you′re thinking of a career in financial services, a manager trying to deal with the market′s insatiable appetite for information, or, just an average investor, there′s a gold mine of common sense in these insightful interviews.” – John T. Olds Vice–Chairman and CEO DBS Group Holdings Ltd</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Olive Torres is used to being the unlucky twin: from inexplicable mishaps to a recent layoff, her life seems to be almost comically jinxed. By contrast, her sister Ami is an eternal champion…she even managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a slew of contests. Unfortunately for Olive, the only thing worse than constant bad luck is having to spend the wedding day with the best man (and her nemesis), Ethan Thomas. Olive braces herself for wedding hell, determined to put on a brave face, but when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. Suddenly there’s a free honeymoon up for grabs, and Olive will be damned if Ethan gets to enjoy paradise solo. Agreeing to a temporary truce, the pair head for Maui. After all, ten days of bliss is worth having to assume the role of loving newlyweds, right? But the weird thing is…Olive doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, the more she pretends to be the luckiest woman alive, the more it feels like she might be. With Christina Lauren’s “uniquely hilarious and touching voice” (Entertainment Weekly), The Unhoneymooners is a romance for anyone who has ever felt unlucky in love.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

He became a billionaire and investment sage by looking at companies as businesses rather than prices on a stock screen. The first two editions of The Warren Buffett Way gave investors their first in–depth look at the innovative investment and business strategies behind Buffett’s spectacular success. The new edition updates readers on the latest investments by Buffett. And, more importantly, it draws on the new field of behavioral finance to explain how investors can overcome the common obstacles that prevent them from investing like Buffett.  New material includes:  How to think like a long–term investor – just like Buffett Why “loss aversion”, the tendency of most investors to overweight the pain of losing money, is one of the biggest obstacles that investors must overcome. Why behaving rationally in the face of the ups and downs of the market has been the key to Buffett’s investing success Analysis of Buffett’s recent acquisition of H.J. Heinz and his investment in IBM stock  The greatest challenge to emulating Buffett is not in the selection of the right stocks, Hagstrom writes, but in having the fortitude to stick with sound investments in the face of economic and market uncertainty. The new edition explains the psychological foundations of Buffett’s approach, thus giving readers the best roadmap yet for mastering both the principles and behaviors that have made Buffett the greatest investor of our generation.</p>\n</div>",

There are hundreds and thousands of successful people in the world who can vouch for the contents of this book. At the time of authors death, about 20 million copies had already been sold. Numerous revisions have been made in the book, from time to time, to make the book more readable and comprehensible to the readers. The book details out the most fundamental questions that once bothered the author, Napoleon Hill. The author once set out on a personal quest to find out what really made some people so successful. Why is it that some people manage to remain healthy, happy and financially independent, all at the same time? Why, after all, do some end up being called as lucky? The answers, no wonder, had to be no less than revelations. For more than a decade, the author interviewed some of the wealthiest and most successful people in the world. It was based on what author learnt in the process from all these people, when asked about how they achieved not just great riches but also personal wellbeing. The author formulated hundreds and thousands of answers, into concise principles which when acted upon, many claim, can help one achieve unprecedented success. The author has in many places narrated short stories and examples that help explain the concept at hand in an engaging manner. Think and Grow Rich teaches not just concepts but also methods. It is not a book that a reader can use for one time consumption. The book, even author recommends, has to be read one br&gt;Chapter at a time and in sequence. Several readers and even some motivational speakers claim to have been reading this book over and over again, few pages at a time, for a long time now. Till date, it remains the number one self help book in the world, as far as sales are concerned! About author: an American journalist, lecturer and author, Napoleon Hill is one of the earliest producers of ‘personal-success literature’. as an author of self-help books, Hill has always abided by and promoted principle of intense and burning passion being the sole key to achieve success. Hill has authored numerous books among which think and Grow Rich has been his most well-known works and had sold over 20 million copies back in the 1930s.</p>\n</div>",

One of his clips was the most watched video on Facebook last year, with over 360 million views. His social media following totals over 32 million, he has produced over 400 viral videos, which have amassed more than 5 billion views, and his podcast, ‘On Purpose’, is consistently ranked the world’s #1 health-related podcast.<br/>\nIn this inspiring, empowering book, Shetty draws on his time as a monk in the Vedic tradition to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and power.

Among the ashes of a dying world, an agent of the Commandment finds a letter. It reads: Burn before reading. Thus begins an unlikely correspondence between two rival agents hellbent on securing the best possible future for their warring factions. Now, what began as a taunt, a battlefield boast, becomes something more. Something epic. Something romantic. Something that could change the past and the future. Except the discovery of their bond would mean the death of each of them. There’s still a war going on, after all. And someone has to win. That’s how war works, right? Cowritten by two beloved and award-winning sci-fi writers, This Is How You Lose the Time War is an epic love story spanning time and space.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Armed with interesting anecdotes, their quirky personalities and a boat, the three men and the dog decide to go on a boat trip across river Thames. But they discover that their fancy ideas of a boat trip, which includes visits to many famous riverside towns of England in the 19th-century, are very different from the reality! Jerome K Jerome’s three men in a Boat is a comic tale of friendship, misadventure and fun. It is a delightful story for all ages and seasons. Hidden within the seemingly funny incidents and comments are the writer’s opinions on the foibles in England’s history and society. The book offers a refreshing look at the various places, people and mannerisms in the country.</p>\n</div>",

Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man’s struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.</p>\n<p>To Kill a Mockingbird is a coming-of-age story, an anti-racist novel, a historical drama of the Great Depression and a sublime example of the Southern writing tradition.</p>\n</div>",

He was the first boy that made me blush, my first official crush. Sounds beautiful so far, right? That excitement that bubbles up inside you, those famous butterflies you feel for the very first time—he was the reason for them all. But, you only get to live in that fairytale world until they crush your hopes and dreams and then stomp on your heart for good measure. And boy did he crush my little heart into pieces.</p>\n<p>After the stomping part he became the boy I did my best to stay away from—and let me tell you, it was pretty hard to do when he slept in the room right across from mine. When tragedy struck his family and they moved away, I was ready to forget he ever existed.</p>\n<p>Now he is a movie star, the one who makes women of all ages go into a screaming frenzy, the one who makes everyone swoon with that dimpled smile of his. Do you think that’s dreamy? I certainly don’t think so. How about me coming face to face with him? Nope still not dreamy. Not when I can’t even manage to look him in the eye.</p>\n<p>Me? I’m Olive, a new writer. Actually, I’m THE writer of the book that inspired the movie he is about to star in on the big screen. As of late, I am also referred to as the oh-so-very-lucky girl who is about to become the wife of Jason Thorn. Maybe you’re thinking yet again that this is all so dreamy?

The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists. For most of my guests, it’s the first time they’ve agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview, and the show is on the cusp of passing 100 million downloads.</b></p>\n<p>“This book contains the distilled tools, tactics, and ‘inside baseball’ you won’t find anywhere else. It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new ‘guests’ you haven’t met.</p>\n<p>“What makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis?</p>\n<p>“I don’t view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can’t test something and replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I’m not interested.</p>\n<p>“Everything within these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. I’ve used dozens of the tactics and philosophies in high-stakes negotiations, high-risk environments, or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration.</p>\n<p>“I created this book, my ultimate notebook of high-leverage tools, for myself. It’s changed my life, and I hope the same for you.”</p>\n</div>",

Over 3 lakh copies sold.’It was like any other day on the Anna University campus in Chennai. As I was returning to my room in the evening, the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, ‘The prime minister wants to talk with you.’ Some months earlier, I had left my post as Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change.’Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off. It brings together details from his career and presidency that are not generally known as he speaks out for the first time on certain points of controversy. It is a continuing saga, above all, of a journey – individual and collective – that will take India to 2020 and beyond as a developed nation.</p>\n</div>",

Starting with a close examination of his own belief in Hinduism, he ranges far and wide in his study of the faith. He talks about the Great Souls of Hinduism, Adi Shankara, Patanjali, Ramanuja, Swami Vivekananda, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and many others who made major contributions to the essence of Hinduism. He delves deep into Hinduism’s most important schools of thought (such as the Advaita Vedanta). He explains, in easily accessible language, important aspects and concepts of Hindu philosophy like the Purusharthas and Bhakti, masterfully summarizes the lessons of the Gita and Vivekananda’s ecumenism and explores with sympathy the ‘Hinduism of habit’ practised by ordinary believers. He looks at the myriad manifestations of political Hinduism in the modern era, including violence committed in the name of the faith by right-wing organizations and their adherents. He analyses Hindutva, explains its rise and dwells at length on the philosophy of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, its most significant ideologue. He is unsparing in his criticism of extremist ‘bhakts’ and unequivocal in his belief that everything that makes India a great and distinctive culture and country will be imperilled if religious ‘fundamentalists’ are allowed to take the upper hand. However, he also makes the point that it is precisely because Hindus form the majority that India has survived as a plural, secular democracy.<br/>\nA book that will be read and debated now and in the future, Why I Am a Hindu is a revelatory and original masterwork.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

This young boy brought about a change in the way people thought about freedom. He was well read and fought extensively for rights – his own, his comrades’ and his countrymen’s. A discussion with a friend soon turned into a matter of self-assessment for Bhagat Singh, leading to a discourse on why he chose to be an atheist. Even in the face of death at a very young age, his uncanny observation leads to his putting forth some pertinent questions. On another occasion, he was disappointed with his father’s plea in Court for his innocence and chose to write a letter to him. This book is a collection of eighteen of his valued writings from within the walls of prison and outside it, which show us the resolve in his words, and the bravery in his acts subsequently.</p>\n</div>",

But it’s only half the story.</p>\n<p>Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn’t see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn’t signed up for. It turned out Will Smith’s education wasn’t nearly over.</p>\n<p>This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i>, <i>Will </i>is the story of how one exceptional man mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world’s biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts <i>Will </i>the book, like its author, in a category by itself.</p>\n<p>‘Bracingly honest, vivid and compelling … how an average talent became the biggest movie star in the world’ <b><i>The Times</i></b><br/>\n‘The Hollywood star’s autobiography is full of indiscretions, drug-fuelled escapades and terrible parenting.
